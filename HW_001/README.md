# First Assignment

Welcome to your first assignment! In this assignment, you will be editing the `main.py` file. Your task is to ensure that the script outputs the correct message and handles input as specified.

## Instructions

1. **Create `main.py`:**
   - Open the `main.py` file.
   - The script should handle input from `stdin`.
   - Ensure that the script outputs the following message:

>*Example 1:*
>
>`Apple` is a user input.
>```
>Hello, what is your name: Apple
>My name is Apple.
>From now on, I will submit all the homework and ensure it is on time. \"@_@"/
>```

>*Example 2:*
>
>`Mr. White` is an user input.
>```
>Hello, what is your name: Mr. White
>My name is Mr. White.
>From now on, I will submit all the homework and ensure it is on time. \"@_@"/
>```

2. **Running the Script Normally:**
   - To run the script normally, open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing `main.py`.
   - Execute the script using Python:
     ```sh
     python main.py
     ```

3. **Running the Script with Test Cases:**
   - To check your script against the provided test cases, you can use the `chk_testcases.py` script.
   - Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing `chk_testcases.py`.
   - Execute the test script using Python:
     ```sh
     python chk_testcases.py
     ```

## Output from the Unittest

Here is an example of what the output might look like when you run the test script:

>```
>..
>----------------------------------------------------------------------
>Ran 2 tests in 0.000s
>
>OK
>```


This output indicates that both test cases have passed successfully. If there are any issues with your script, the unittest framework will provide detailed information about the failures.
